I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in [**Engineering and Public Policy**](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Nick Muller. My current research explores the environmental-economic tradeoffs of oil and gas activities and examines how vehicle emission information impacts consumers' perceptions of automakers and vehicles. 

I also serve as a [**Teaching Consultant Fellow**](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/services/graduateteachingfellows/index.html) at the [**Eberly Center**](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/), where I help graduate students and postdoctoral fellows integrate evidence-based teaching strategies in their classroom.
<!-- I hope to occasionally [**blog**](https://thuydtnguyen.github.io/post/). -->
